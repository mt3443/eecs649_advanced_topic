# EECS 649 Advanced Topic: RNNoise

This program uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to remove background noise from audio files. Installation instructions can be found in the readme in the `rnnoise` directory. Examples have been placed in the `examples` directory. I removed noise from a sample audio file using RNNoise and two traditional noise removal algorithms. I included two more algorithms to show you how effective RNNoise really is at removing background noise. The two traditional noise removal algorithms were [BRIL](https://www.dspalgorithms.com/www/bril/bril.php) and the noise reduction algorithm used in [Audacity](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/noise_reduction.html). I encourage you to compare the before file with each of the after files, and decide which algorithm you think is the best.
